# MultiChat Prompt Sender

A Tampermonkey userscript that adds a powerful panel for sending sequences of prompts to multiple AI chat models automatically.

This tool is designed for AI researchers, developers, and power users who need to test and compare responses from various AI models. It automates the tedious process of sending the same prompts across different chats, allowing for efficient, parallel testing and analysis directly within the web interface.

**Advanced Test Automation & Control**

1.  **Automated Multi-Chat Execution:** Select multiple AI models and the script will automatically navigate to each chat, sending your predefined prompts in sequence.
2.  **Sequential Prompt Chains:** Configure a series of prompts, each with a custom message count and delay. The script executes all prompts for the first model before moving to the next, ensuring complete test cycles per model.
3.  **Dual Execution Modes:** Run a full test across all selected models, or use the "Run in Opened Chat" button for instant, focused testing on a single model without reloading the page.
4.  **Live Progress Tracking:** Monitor the testing process in real-time with a clear indicator showing the current model and task being executed.

3.  **Easy Prompt Configuration:** Add, remove, and edit multiple prompts on the fly.
4.  **Import & Export:** Save your complex prompt configurations to an `.xlsx` file and easily import them back, streamlining repetitive testing sessions.
